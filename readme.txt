An incremental game that promotes active play. Takes place in a cafe setting. 
Build and upgrade a restaurant and progress from a small cafe to a 
world-famous restaurant.

Required Modules and programs:
-python 3
-pygame
http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

Running Instructions:
1. Open Project Codebase
2. Open main.py using preferred python interpreter
3. Run main.py

Instructions:

Building:
	During the break, users can build furniture and place it on the board.
	If the user has enough money, simply click the build button, click
	the desired furniture type, and click the location directly on the 
	restaurant.

Money:
	Money is earned through sales. Different foods sell for different base
	prices. This can be found upon further inspection of the food.py file.
	An additional "tip" is added based on customer satisfaction. The faster
	customers recieve their food, the higher their satisfaction. 
	
	Money is also deducted through purchasing furniture and wages for employees.
	The cost for a waiter is 15/day and a chef is 30/day.

Employees:
	A chef picks a stove to work at in the beginning of the day. No other
	chef can then work on that stove. The chef will place food to the closest 
	counter that is not currently being used.

	A waiter randomly takes food from counters, to encourage serving different
	food types as a counter can only have one type of food on it at a time.
	Waiters serve on a first come first serve basis.
